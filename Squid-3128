# Try to proxify curl
curl --proxy http://10.10.11.131:3128 http://10.10.11.131

python spose.py --proxy http://10.10.11.131:3128 --target 10.10.11.131

Nmap proxified
You can also try to abuse the proxy to scan internal ports proxifying nmap.
Configure proxychains to use the squid proxy adding he following line at the end of the proxichains.conf file: http 10.10.10.10 3128 For proxies requiring authentication, append credentials to the configuration by including the username and password at the end: http 10.10.10.10 3128 username passw0rd.

Then run nmap with proxychains to scan the host from local: proxychains nmap -sT -n -p- localhost
